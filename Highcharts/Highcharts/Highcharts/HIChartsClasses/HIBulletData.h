/**
* description: An array of data points for the series. For the bullet series type,
points can be given in the following ways:

An array of arrays with 3 or 2 values. In this case, the values
correspond to x,y,target. If the first value is a string,
it is applied as the name of the point, and the x value is inferred.
The x value can also be omitted, in which case the inner arrays
should be of length 2. Then the x value is automatically calculated,
either starting at 0 and incremented by 1, or from pointStart
and pointInterval given in the series options.
data: [
    [0, 40, 75],
    [1, 50, 50],
    [2, 60, 40]
]


An array of objects with named values. The objects are point
configuration objects as seen below. If the total number of data
points exceeds the series' turboThreshold,
this option is not available.
data: [{
    x: 0,
    y: 40,
    target: 75,
    name: "Point1",
    color: "#00FF00"
}, {
    x: 1,
    y: 60,
    target: 40,
    name: "Point2",
    color: "#FF00FF"
}]
