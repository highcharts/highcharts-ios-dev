* description: <p>Possible values: <code>null</code>, <code>"on"</code>, <code>"between"</code>.</p>
<p>In a column chart, when pointPlacement is <code>"on"</code>, the point will not create any padding of the X axis. In a polar column chart this means that the first column points directly north. If the pointPlacement is <code>"between"</code>, the columns will be laid out between ticks. This is useful for example for visualising an amount between two points in time or in a certain sector of a polar chart.</p>
<p>Since Highcharts 3.0.2, the point placement can also be numeric, where 0 is on the axis value, -0.5 is between this value and the previous, and 0.5 is between this value and the next. Unlike the textual options, numeric point placement options won't affect axis padding.</p>
<p>Note that pointPlacement needs a <a href="#plotOptions.series.pointRange">pointRange</a> to work. For column series this is computed, but for line-type series it needs to be set.</p>
<p>Defaults to <code>null</code> in cartesian charts, <code>"between"</code> in polar charts.
