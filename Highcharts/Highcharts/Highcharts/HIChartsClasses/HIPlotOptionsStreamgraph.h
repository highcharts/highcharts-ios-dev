The animation can also be set as a configuration object. Please
note that this option only applies to the initial animation of the
series itself. For other animations, see chart.animation and the animation parameter under the API methods. The
following properties are supported:

duration
The duration of the animation in milliseconds.
easing
A string reference to an easing function set on the Math object.
See the Custom easing function demo below.

Due to poor performance, animation is disabled in old IE browsers
for several chart types.
