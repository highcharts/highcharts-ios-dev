/**
* description: An array of data points for the series. For the columnrange series type, points can be given in the following ways:
 
An array of arrays with 3 or 2 values. In this case, the values correspond to x,low,high. If the first value is a string, it is
 	applied as the name of the point, and the x value is inferred. The x value can also be omitted, in which case the inner arrays should be of length 2. Then the x value is automatically calculated, either starting at 0 and incremented by 1, or from pointStart 
 	and pointInterval given in the series options.
data: [
    [0, 4, 2], 
    [1, 2, 1], 
    [2, 9, 10]
]
An array of objects with named values. The objects are
 	point configuration objects as seen below. If the total number of data points exceeds the series' turboThreshold, this option is not available.
data: [{
    x: 1,
    low: 0,
    high: 4,
    name: "Point2",
    color: "#00FF00"
}, {
    x: 1,
    low: 5,
    high: 3,
    name: "Point1",
    color: "#FF00FF"
}]

* demo: The demos use a line series, but the principle is the same for all types.
