/**
* description: An array of data points for the series. For the gauge series type, points can be given in the following ways:
 
An array of numerical values. In this case, the numerical values will 
 	be interpreted as y options.  Example:
data: [0, 5, 3, 5]

An array of objects with named values. The objects are
 	point configuration objects as seen below. If the total number of data points exceeds the series' turboThreshold, this option is not available.
data: [{
    y: 6,
    name: "Point2",
    color: "#00FF00"
}, {
    y: 8,
    name: "Point1",
    color: "#FF00FF"
}]
The typical gauge only contains a single data value.
* demo: The demos use a line series, but the principle is the same for all types.
