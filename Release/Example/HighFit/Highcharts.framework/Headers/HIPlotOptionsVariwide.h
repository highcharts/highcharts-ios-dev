/**
* description: Possible values: null, "on", "between".
In a column chart, when pointPlacement is "on", the point will
not create any padding of the X axis. In a polar column chart this
means that the first column points directly north. If the pointPlacement
is "between", the columns will be laid out between ticks. This
is useful for example for visualising an amount between two points
in time or in a certain sector of a polar chart.
Since Highcharts 3.0.2, the point placement can also be numeric,
where 0 is on the axis value, -0.5 is between this value and the
previous, and 0.5 is between this value and the next. Unlike the
textual options, numeric point placement options won't affect axis
padding.
Note that pointPlacement needs a pointRange to work. For column series this is computed, but for
line-type series it needs to be set.
Defaults to null in cartesian charts, "between" in polar charts.
