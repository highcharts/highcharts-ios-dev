* description: Defines how the labels are be repositioned according to the 3D chart

'offset': Maintain a fixed horizontal/vertical distance from the
   tick marks, despite the chart orientation. This is the backwards
   compatible behavior, and causes skewing of X and Z axes.
'chart': Preserve 3D position relative to the chart.
This looks nice, but hard to read if the text isn't
forward-facing.
'flap': Rotated text along the axis to compensate for the chart
   orientation. This tries to maintain text as legible as possible on
   all orientations.
'ortho': Rotated text along the axis direction so that the labels
   are orthogonal to the axis. This is very similar to 'flap', but
   prevents skewing the labels (X and Y scaling are still present).
