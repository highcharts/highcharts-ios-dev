/**
 A `sankey` series. If the `type` option is not specified, it is inherited from `chart.type`.
 
 Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:
 
 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the `plotOptions.series` object.
 
 2. Options for all `sankey` series are defined in `plotOptions.sankey`.
 
 3. Options for one single series are given in `the series instance array`.
 
 <pre>
 Highcharts.chart('container', {
    plotOptions: {
        series: {
            // general options for all series
        },
        sankey: {
            // shared options for all sankey series
        }
    },
    series: [{
        // specific options for this series instance
        type: 'sankey'
    }]
 });
