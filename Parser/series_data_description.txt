/**
 An array of data points for the series. The points can be given in three ways:
 </br></br>1. An array of numerical values. In this case, the numerical values will
 be interpreted as `y` values, and `x` values will be automatically calculated,
 either starting at 0 and incrementing by 1, or from `pointStart`
 and `pointInterval` given in the plotOptions. If the axis is
 has categories, these will be used. This option is not available for range series. Example:
 <pre>
 data: [0, 5, 3, 5]
 </pre>
 </br>2. An array of arrays with two values. In this case, the first value is the
 `x` value and the second is the `y` value. If the first value is a string, it is
 applied as the name of the point, and the `x` value is incremented following
 the above rules. For range series, the arrays will be interpreted as `[x, low, high]`. In this cases, the `X` value can be skipped altogether to make use of `pointStart` and `pointRange`.
 Example:
 <pre>
 data: [
     [0, 9],
     [1, 2],
     [2, 8]
 ]
 </pre>
 </br>3. An array of objects with named values. In this case the objects are
 point configuration objects as seen below. Range series values are given by low and high.
 Example:
 <pre>
 data: [{
     x: 1,
     y: 9,
     name: "Point2",
     color: "#00FF00"
 }, {
     x: 1,
     y: 0,
     name: "Point1",
     color: "#FF00FF"
 }]
 </pre>Note that line series and derived types like spline and area, require data to be sorted by X because it interpolates mouse coordinates for the tooltip. Column and scatter series, where each point has its own mouse event, does not require sorting.
